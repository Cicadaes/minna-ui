## [Unreleased]

## [0.3.0] - 2018-06-27

### Added

- Simple table styles.

### Changed

- Refactor font sizes and use `em` instead of `rem`.
- Change some whitespace to suit new font sizes.
- Better font family system stack, now more inclusive of all common operating systems.
- Use bold font weight to show active nav items.
- Better SVG image alignment in `@minna-ui/navbar`.

### Fixed

- `.mono` class should not look like `.code`.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-06-14

### Added

- New file size badge in README of the [`@minna-ui/css`](https://github.com/WeAreGenki/minna-ui/tree/master/css) and each component package. Please keep in mind, for components, it shows the file size of the JavaScript bundle but not the CSS bundle due to a limitation in the service.
- New neutral font colour.
- Unit tests for CLI scripts.

### Removed

- Default margin between button. This should be up to the developer to decide based on their specific usage scenario.

### Changed

- Improved accessibility for form inputs and the toggle component. More noticeable visual focus indicator.
- Simplified side nav styles.
- Labels are now less prominent.
- Refine CSS animations for `.card-touch`.

- Updated package dependencies.

## [0.1.0] - 2018-05-23

### Added

- Unit tests for all packages. Coverage now at 100% ðŸŽ‰
- Wrote a simple readme for some packages but these are still a work in progress.

### Changed

- Component builds are now powered by rollup, replacing our custom build script. Builds are much more flexible and reliable now.
- New standalone option for `@minna-ui/postcss-config` to be used when `@minna-ui/css` is not installed.
- Simplify jest svelte transform.
- Updated package dependencies.

### Fixed
