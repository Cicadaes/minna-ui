### Fixed

- Bracket parsing doesn't match in `@minna-ui/svelte-preprocess-markup`. This is only a partial fix and so you need to quote any `{}` tags that contain `{` or `}` characters.

## [0.3.0] - 2018-06-27

### Added

- Simple table styles.

### Changed

- Refactor font sizes.
- Use `em` instead of `rem` in places where it makes sense.
- Change some whitespace to suit new font sizes.
- Better font family system stack, now more inclusive of all common operating systems.
- Use bold font weight to show active nav items.
- Better SVG image alignment in `@minna-ui/navbar`.
- Adjust `@minna-ui/navbar` body offset for better compatibility with system fonts.
- Updated package dependencies.

### Fixed

- Headers causing the page to overflow (but be mindful about where words may be split when overflowing).
- `.mono` class should not look like `.code`.

## [0.2.0] - 2018-06-14

### Added

- New file size badge in README of the [`@minna-ui/css`](https://github.com/WeAreGenki/minna-ui/tree/master/css) and each component package. Please keep in mind, for components, it shows the file size of the JavaScript bundle but not the CSS bundle due to a limitation in the service.
- New neutral font colour.
- Unit tests for CLI scripts.

### Removed

- Default margin between button. This should be up to the developer to decide based on their specific usage scenario.

### Changed

- Improved accessibility for form inputs and the toggle component. More noticeable visual focus indicator.
- Simplified side nav styles.
- Labels are now less prominent.
- Refine CSS animations for `.card-touch`.
- Update jest to v23.0.0 and rewrite preset to use the newly supported `jest-preset.js` (instead of `jest-preset.json`).
- Updated package dependencies.

## [0.1.0] - 2018-05-23

### Added

- Unit tests for all packages. Coverage now at 100% ðŸŽ‰
- Wrote a simple readme for some packages but these are still a work in progress.

### Changed

- Component builds are now powered by rollup, replacing our custom build script. Builds are much more flexible and reliable now.
- New standalone option for `@minna-ui/postcss-config` to be used when `@minna-ui/css` is not installed.
- Simplify jest svelte transform.
- Updated package dependencies.

### Fixed

- Tweaked `@minna-ui/eslint-config` and `@minna-ui/jest-config` to work better with unit tests.
- Some edge cases in CSS mixins which were discovered via new unit tests.

## 0.0.0 - 2018-05-18
